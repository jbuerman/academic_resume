This year's AAMAS conference was hosted online on the [underline.io](https://underline.io) platform. My [talk](https://underline.io/lecture/270-fair-allocation-of-resources-with-uncertain-availability) presenting the work and the results of the accepted paper ["Fair Allocation of Resources With Uncertain Availability"](../../publication/buermann-2020-aamas-fair-allocation-under-uncertainty) is available on this website. The paper was joint work with [Enrico H. Gerding](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~eg/) and [Baharak Rastegari](https://sites.google.com/view/baharrastegari).
