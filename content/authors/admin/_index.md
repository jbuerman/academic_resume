I am Research Fellow in AI for Maritime Futures at the Centre for Maritime Futures. I am in the Agents, Interaction and Complexity (AIC) research group in the Department of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) at the University of Southampton. My current research is on the decarbonisation of shipping, including the investigation of upgrading of shipping vessels and fleets in response to carbon intensity targets and carbon taxes as well as the investigation of efficient carbon taxes.

During my PhD my research I focused on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms in the area of multi-agent systems. I contributed to the areas of fair allocation of homogeneous resources and optimal random robot movement strategies on poly-lines.

Before joining Southampton, I received my MSc in computer science from the University of Paderborn (Germany) where I worked on the usage of information to influence routing decisions in everyday traffic situations (routing games under uncertainty).
